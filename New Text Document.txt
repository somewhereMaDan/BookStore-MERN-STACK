Store - Global Object

useSelector -> like a guy which can directly talk to the store. Component can't just directly go to store to get the data they use this hook, so that key could selectively ask that I need this information.

reducers -> almost  like controllers, job is to update, delete, add the thing.
	It'll have key value thing which will have actions

useDispatch -> whenever you want to update some info in the store, we do that using reducers but we can't directly call the reducers it'll break the flow. 
	we use this hook, through this we'll call a selective reducer at and this reducer will get updated in the store.
